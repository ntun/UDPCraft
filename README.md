# UDPCraft
This project involves converting  the [(Mine)Craft](https://github.com/fogleman/Craft) clone's TCP to UDP as UDP generally provides better performance in games. This repo does not, however, contain _all_ necessary files to replicate the project. Please refer to the [project report](https://github.com/ntun/UDPCraft/blob/master/project_report.pdf) for more information about dependencies and the results. Also, please look at [(Mine)Craft's README.md](https://github.com/fogleman/Craft/blob/master/README.md) for initial setup and installation.
